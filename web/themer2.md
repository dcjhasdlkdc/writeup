so this was themer2 which meant i had to do the same thing change the theme . 
didnt know to what so i opened the file attached in it.
i thought might had to use payloads in this one. 
so i found a github repository to get payloads --> %2e%2e%2f 
which helped me enter Flag.txt bypassing the ../ remover -->    safe_theme = safe_theme.replace("../", "") in zip file .

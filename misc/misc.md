sanity  -  it had the flag next to rules in discord had to search for it no logic in it 

password - hardest one on the challenge for me . 
 i knew i hate to use a brute forcer and it had to do something with the time it gave back but i couldnt figure it out . i think this was due to my lack of 
knowledge  in this field and i did this one at last so i didnt have enough time to learn it on spot and figure it out . i will try this one after some knowlege 
and get it eventually . 

it was really fun to participate in this this ctf challenge even if it was a bit small but i would love to keep learning and participating . thank you

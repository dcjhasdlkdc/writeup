osint was easy so i will cover it in one file itself.

wannabe1 - using exiftool found BitforBat in base64 form (i was a bit confused at first coz i am used to base64 ending with = soooo but i found it eventually)

wannabe2 - there was a equation which i put in a website which converts equation into graph

wannabe3 - there was a location file which meant city has to be in it and the discritption of challenge also has location word in it. the last there worlds 
i put them in google and on map it showed new delhi

wannabe4 - this one wasnt as easy as others i have an habit to select text while reading it and eventually found the --- and --. suspicious   and knew it was 
morse code which decoded to save me .

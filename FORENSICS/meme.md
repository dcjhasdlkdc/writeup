i was really sad not being about to comeplete this one on time.
so after seeing the png i was something related to github but it wasnt clear i was sure that was it used stegsolve to see ti more clearly. 
so something user/github.io but didnt work. wend to do other wuestions came back. it took me some time to realise that if it was related to github it might endup being related to 
osint? so i gave up on github thinking it as fake. no tool worked zsteg gave nothing.
at the end of the ctf i gave a a second thought to the name of challenge which gave short form to MSB which was just sad realisation for me. 
i used pillow tool which was in file given in webinar 
used python3 zstegbutbetter.py -t=msb -out=idk chall.jpg
